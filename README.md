This Project is based on the logical topology and connection of the Networks. 
In the physical tab, the items are not organised to reflect a real network as it exceeds the scope of the project.
The passwords used in this project are easy to remember on purpose for configuration purposes, they do not in any means reflect real application.
The default passwords of Routers and HomeGateways are not changed for convinience in configurations and testing.
